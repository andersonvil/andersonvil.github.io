  title     = {How to Incorporate Children into Labor Supply Equations? A General Framework
},
  abstract  = {We provide a novel method for modeling and estimating the impact of children on labor supply decisions. We rely on the literature on equivalence scales
				and collective models. Our approach takes into account both the time and
				monetary costs of raising children. Using semiparametric restrictions on indi
				vidual preferences, we identify the cost of children from the curvature of the
				labor supply equations with low data requirements. We apply the model to
				PSID data from the USA and investigate the women’s labor supply sensitivity,
				the cost of children, and the women’s price of time. We find that women’s
				labor supply is highly sensitive to wage variations. In addition, we show that
				mothers allocate, on average, 44% of their net total expenditures to children.
				Finally, by comparing our findings to those derived from other studies using
				children’s expense data, our model provides relatively consistent predictions
				regarding the cost of children.
