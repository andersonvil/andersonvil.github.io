  abstract  = {We propose a method to assess the full cost of children by endogenously identifying the price of parental time, which is not assumed to equal the parentâ€™s wage rate. Instead, the price of time depends on how parents perceive their time spent with children. Our model builds on a collective labor supply framework for couples, incorporating distinct individual preferences and childcare technology. Using 2019 PSID data, we find that 68\% of mothers' childcare time is perceived as work, compared to 53\% for fathers. Additionally, our results show that a significant share of the full cost of children is non-monetary.
