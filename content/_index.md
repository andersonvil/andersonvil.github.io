Hello everyone, and welcome to my website!

I’m Anderson VIL, a Postdoctoral Fellow in Economics at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) and a member of [THEMA (UMR CNRS 8184)](https://thema.u-cergy.fr/).

I obtained a Ph.D. in Economics from [Cergy Paris Université](https://www.cyu.fr/), under the supervision of [Olivier Donni](https://sites.google.com/view/olivierdonni). In 2023, I visited [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven) as a guest researcher, hosted by [Frederic Vermeulen](https://sites.google.com/site/fmpvermeulen/).

My research lies in applied microeconomics, with a particular focus on **household behavior**, including **demand analysis**, **labor supply**, and the **intra-household allocation of resources**. I also explore issues related to **working from home** and its implications for **time use** and **gender roles within households**.
