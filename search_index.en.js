Suddenly, your mother appears with a bit of a mysterious look and says, “Son, I’d really like to have another baby. Wouldn’t you like a little brother or sister?”\nNow, this might surprise you, but your answer could very well depend on the family finances. Yep! According to a study by Vil (2025), your feelings might be influenced by the resources you could stand to lose (or not) if this new baby arrives.\nLet’s picture this. If you’re in a family where every euro counts, you might respond to your mother, a bit sheepishly, ``Uh… Mom, no thanks. Anderson says you’ll give me less money if I get a little brother or sister.'' It might sound a little materialistic, but if resources become scarcer, it means that treats, fun, and even some essentials might need to be split up differently—and not necessarily in your favor. You might prefer to stay an only child to keep your little world intact and… well-provided for.\nBut now, imagine you’re in a wealthy family. Here, when your mother asks if you’d like a little brother or sister, your answer could be completely different: ``What are you waiting for, Mom? Aren’t you pregnant yet?'' If the family has enough resources, an extra child won’t affect the budget available for each kid. Basic expenses only nibble at the family’s income, so even with a new baby, the share allocated to each child doesn’t really decrease. In short, you’ll get a playmate without sacrificing any of your financial perks.\nThe idea behind this is simple, but let’s break it down with some numbers to make it clearer. Imagine your mom earns minimum wage, say 1400 euros per month. After rent, transportation, groceries, and all the essential expenses, she has only 100 euros left for extras. And that little extra, she gives it to you for your hobbies, desires, and small luxuries. Now, if another child enters the picture, that tiny 100 euros would need to be split between you two. The result? Each of you gets less, and everyone has to compromise a bit.\nOn the other hand, in a family with a more comfortable income, basic expenses are easily covered without eating too much into the budget. The parent can then support multiple children without anyone needing to tighten their belt. In other words, even with one or two additional siblings, your little comforts aren’t going anywhere.\nSo, if one day your mom asks you that big question, think it through: do you want a playmate or a rival for your pocket money? Your answer might depend more on the wallet than on the heart!\n\n\tChildren Resource Share by Household Total Expenditures\n\t\n\nFrench version🔗\nEnfants uniques ou fratrie : Quand l’argent décide pour les familles🔗\nChers lecteurs, imaginez un instant cette scène : vous êtes fils ou fille unique, tranquillement en train de vaquer à vos occupations. Soudain, votre mère débarque, l’air un peu mystérieux, et vous lance : « Mon enfant, j’aimerais bien avoir un autre enfant. Ça te plairait pas d’avoir un petit frère ou une petite sœur ? »\nBon, ça peut vous surprendre, mais votre réponse pourrait bien dépendre de l’argent qui tourne dans la famille. Eh oui ! Selon les résultats d’une étude de Vil (2025), vos sentiments pourraient être influencés par les ressources que vous pourriez perdre (ou pas) si ce fameux bébé arrivait.\nImaginons la scène. Si vous êtes dans une famille où chaque euro compte, vous pourriez bien répondre à votre mère, tout penaud : « Euh… maman, non merci. Anderson dit que tu me donneras moins d’argent si j’ai un petit frère ou une petite sœur. » Ça peut paraître un peu matérialiste, mais si les ressources deviennent plus rares, cela signifie que les petites gâteries, les loisirs, et même certains besoins peuvent être répartis différemment, et pas forcément en votre faveur. Vous pourriez alors préférer rester enfant unique, pour garder tout votre petit monde intact et… bien fourni.\nMais maintenant, imaginez que vous vivez dans une famille aisée. Là, quand votre mère vous demande si vous voulez un petit frère ou une petite sœur, votre réponse pourrait être très différente : « Mais qu’est-ce que t’attends, maman ? T’es pas encore enceinte ? » En effet, si les ressources de la famille sont suffisamment élevées, un enfant supplémentaire n’affectera pas le budget disponible pour chacun. Les dépenses de base ne grignotent qu’une petite part des revenus familiaux, ce qui fait que, même avec un nouveau bébé, la part allouée à chaque enfant ne va pas vraiment baisser. En gros, vous aurez un camarade de jeu sans sacrifier vos privilèges financiers.\nL’idée derrière tout ça est simple, mais parlons chiffres pour mieux comprendre. Imaginez que votre mère gagne le SMIC, disons 1400 euros par mois. Entre le loyer, le transport, les courses et toutes les dépenses essentielles, il ne lui reste que 100 euros pour les extras. Et ce petit extra, elle vous le donne pour vos loisirs, vos envies. Si on fait entrer dans l’équation un autre enfant, c’est comme si ce maigre 100 euros devait être partagé entre vous deux. Résultat : chacun reçoit moins, et tout le monde doit faire des compromis.\nÀ l’inverse, dans une famille où les revenus sont plus confortables, les dépenses de base sont largement couvertes sans entamer trop de budget. Le parent peut donc facilement soutenir plusieurs enfants sans qu’aucun n’ait à serrer la ceinture. En d’autres termes, même avec un ou deux petits frères ou sœurs en plus, votre petit confort, lui, ne risque pas de bouger d’un centime.\nAlors, si un jour votre mère vous pose cette fameuse question, réfléchissez bien : est-ce que vous avez envie d’un compagnon de jeu ou d’un rival pour vos économies ? La réponse pourrait dépendre plus du porte-monnaie que du cœur !\n\n\tProportion des ressources allouées aux enfants en fonction des dépenses totales du ménage\n\t\n\n","id":"https://andersonvil.github.io/blog/children-don-t-matter/","title":"One Child or Many? How Finances Shape Family Decisions"},"https://andersonvil.github.io/blog/substitution-income-effects/":{"body":"English version🔗\nFor those of you who, like me, didn’t exactly manage to catch a nap in economics class, you’ve probably heard your teacher talk about the substitution effect and the income effect. Yeah, I know, it sounds a bit dull, but stick with me—it’s going to be more fun than it seems.\nImagine you have a job, dear readers, and your boss—an ardent Donald Trump fan—gets into a generous mood after his favorite candidate wins the election. In his enthusiasm, he decides to finally make good on his promise and raises your hourly wage from $15 to $20. Nice, right? This little raise might make you want to work more hours, say from 6 hours a day to 10, to pile up a bit more cash (maybe to finally swap out that clunker you’ve been driving for years). Realistically, I’m not sure an extra $5 will be enough for that, but hey, it’s the idea that counts.\nIn economic terms, this urge to work more because your leisure time just got more expensive with your new wage rate is what they call the substitution effect. Basically, each hour you spend not working now costs you $20 instead of $15—that’s what economists call the opportunity cost. Leisure—those moments when you’re not doing anything but enjoying life—suddenly feels pricier, and next thing you know, you’re swapping some of your downtime for extra hours at work. That’s the substitution effect.\nNow, let’s say this raise suddenly makes you feel a bit wealthier. Instead of grinding for even more hours to build up your savings, you might just decide to take it easy and enjoy life a little more! You think, “Hey, with $20 an hour instead of $15, I can afford to take a breather and treat myself to a few pleasures!” That’s what economists call the income effect: you’re tempted to work less because you feel more financially secure, and, let’s face it, you want to appreciate life a bit more.\nSo why am I telling you all this? Because when it comes to studying the cost of children, Olivier Donni (the Jedi master of my thesis) and I realized we could apply this same reasoning to understand how kids influence parents’ work decisions. Not seeing the connection? Let me break it down.\nHaving kids costs money (yep, you have to pay for their toys, education, and all that), but that’s not all. Kids also require your time. And here’s where things get interesting: the time you spend with them competes directly with the time you could be spending at work. It’s like each hour you spend working just got way more expensive because every hour at the office is an hour you’re not spending with your kids. That’s what we call the substitution effect: having children can encourage parents, especially moms, to cut back on work hours to spend more time with their kids.\nBut there’s more to it. When you have kids, your expenses go up. It’s no longer just about luxuries or little treats; they’re real needs that come with real costs. To cover these expenses, many parents—again, often mothers—feel the need to work more to meet the family’s needs. That’s the income effect: having children makes parents work more to offset the extra costs.\nSo, here’s an image I generated with ChatGPT to show how this all fits together (thanks, ChatGPT, by the way!). On the left, you see the substitution effect: having kids can make parents want to work less to spend more time with them. On the right, you’ve got the income effect: to pay for everything that comes with having kids, parents are motivated to work more.\nFor a long time, economists studying how children influence parents’ work choices often overlooked this income effect. That’s where Olivier and me come in with a new study Donni and Vil (2024). We propose a structural model that considers both effects—the substitution effect and the income effect—to understand how having children impacts the number of hours parents choose to work.\nIn short, our analysis takes this question to a new level, showing that working more or less because of children isn’t just a choice but also a matter of cost and the value of time. So, the next time you see a mom at the office or at the park, think about it: her schedule is a fine balance between the substitution and income effects. And that might just be the best way to learn a bit of economics outside the classroom. Guys, no need to feel left out! Balancing work and family is just as much your game!\n\n\tSubstitution Effect vs Income Effect\n\t\n\nFrench version🔗\nTravailler ou Pouponner : Les Enfants, ces Petits Maîtres de l’Économie Domestique🔗\nPour ceux qui, comme moi, n'ont pas eu la chance de piquer un petit somme en cours d'économie, vous avez sûrement déjà entendu votre prof parler d'effet de substitution et d'effet de revenu. Oui, je sais, ça a l'air un peu barbant, mais restez avec moi, ça va être plus fun que ça en a l’air.\nImaginez que vous avez un job, mes chers lecteurs, et que votre patron, un fervent admirateur de Donald Trump, se sent d’humeur généreuse après la victoire de son candidat préféré. Il décide de tenir sa promesse et d’augmenter votre salaire horaire de 15 $ à 20 $. Sympa, non ? Cette petite hausse pourrait vous donner envie de bosser plus d'heures, disons, de 6 heures à 10 heures par jour, pour accumuler plus d’argent (pour enfin changer cette vieille bagnole que vous traînez depuis des années). Bon, soyons réalistes, je ne suis pas sûr que ces 5 dollars de plus suffiront, mais c’est l’idée.\nDans le jargon des économistes, cette envie de travailler davantage, parce que chaque heure de loisirs coûte maintenant plus cher à cause de votre nouveau taux horaire, c’est ce qu’ils appellent l’effet de substitution. En d'autres termes, chaque heure passée à ne pas bosser vous coûte désormais 20 $ au lieu de 15 $ – c'est le coût d’opportunité. Le loisir, ce moment où vous ne faites rien d’autre que profiter de la vie, devient alors plus cher à vos yeux, et vous voilà en train de troquer quelques heures de repos pour des heures de boulot en plus. L'effet de substitution, c'est ça.\nMais maintenant, imaginez que cette augmentation vous fait soudain vous sentir un peu plus riche. Plutôt que de gratter toujours plus d'heures pour accumuler des billets, vous pourriez décider de profiter de la vie ! Vous vous dites : « Hey, avec 20 $ de l’heure au lieu de 15 $, je peux me permettre de lever le pied et de me payer quelques plaisirs ! » C'est ce que les économistes appellent l’effet de revenu : vous êtes tenté de bosser moins parce que vous vous sentez plus à l’aise financièrement et que, mine de rien, vous avez envie d’apprécier un peu votre vie.\nAlors pourquoi je vous raconte tout ça ? Parce qu’en étudiant le coût des enfants, Olivier Donni (le maître Jedi de ma thèse) et moi-même avons trouvé qu’on pouvait utiliser ce raisonnement pour comprendre comment les enfants influencent le travail des parents. Vous ne voyez pas le lien ? Laissez-moi vous expliquer.\nAvoir des enfants, ça coûte de l'argent (eh oui, il faut bien payer pour leurs jouets, leur éducation, etc.), mais ce n’est pas tout. Les enfants demandent aussi du temps. Et là, le temps que vous passez avec eux est en concurrence directe avec le temps que vous pourriez passer à bosser. C’est comme si chaque heure de travail devenait super chère, parce qu’à chaque fois que vous êtes au boulot, c’est du temps que vous ne passez pas avec vos enfants. C’est ce qu’on appelle l’effet de substitution : avoir des enfants pourrait bien inciter les parents, et surtout les mamans, à réduire leurs heures de travail pour passer plus de temps avec eux.\nMais ça ne s’arrête pas là. Quand on a des enfants, les dépenses augmentent. Ce ne sont plus seulement des loisirs ou des petits caprices ; ce sont des besoins réels qui coûtent cher. Pour couvrir ces dépenses, beaucoup de parents, et encore une fois surtout les mères, se sentent obligés de bosser plus pour subvenir aux besoins de la famille. Ça, c’est l’effet de revenu : la présence des enfants pousse à travailler davantage pour compenser les frais supplémentaires.\nAlors, voilà l’image que j’ai générée avec ChatGPT pour illustrer tout ça (merci, ChatGPT, au passage !). À gauche, vous avez l’effet de substitution : avoir des enfants, ça pousse à travailler moins pour passer plus de temps avec eux. À droite, vous avez l’effet de revenu : pour payer tout ce qui concerne les enfants, ça pousse à travailler plus.\nPendant longtemps, les économistes ont étudié comment les enfants influencent les décisions de travail des parents, mais beaucoup ont négligé cet effet de revenu. C’est là que Donni et Vil (2024) entrent en jeu avec une nouvelle étude. Ils proposent un modèle structurel qui prend en compte les deux effets – l’effet de substitution et l’effet de revenu – pour comprendre comment le fait d’avoir des enfants impacte les heures de travail des parents.\nEn bref, notre analyse prend une nouvelle dimension, en montrant que bosser plus ou moins en fonction des enfants, c’est pas juste une question de choix, mais aussi de coût et de valeur du temps. Alors, la prochaine fois que vous verrez une maman au bureau ou au parc, pensez-y : son emploi du temps est un savant mélange entre effet de substitution et effet de revenu. Et ça, c’est peut-être le meilleur moyen de comprendre l'économie en dehors des salles de classe. Et messieurs, pas de jalousie ! Ce jonglage travail-famille,  il s’applique aussi à vous !\n\n\tEffet de substitution vs Effet de revenu\n\t\n\n","id":"https://andersonvil.github.io/blog/substitution-income-effects/","title":"Working or Parenting: How Kids Rule the Household Economy"},"https://andersonvil.github.io/contacts/":{"body":"","id":"https://andersonvil.github.io/contacts/","title":"Contact"},"https://andersonvil.github.io/publications/":{"body":"Topic of interest🔗\nMy research interests focus on applied microeconomics.

It introduces the concept of general equilibrium, where the interactions between multiple markets are considered, and explores the conditions necessary for an economy to operate efficiently. Students learn why perfectly competitive markets tend to produce efficient outcomes and what happens when these conditions are not met. Key sources of inefficiency, such as incomplete information, externalities, and public goods, are analyzed to understand their impact on resource allocation and economic outcomes.\nThis course also delves into practical solutions to market failures, such as signaling to address information asymmetry, private bargaining for externalities, and government tools like taxes, subsidies, and tradable permits to improve efficiency. By studying these mechanisms, students develop the analytical skills to evaluate when government intervention is necessary and how policies can be designed to correct inefficiencies effectively. This class equips students with a normative perspective on economic efficiency and a deeper understanding of the trade-offs involved in public policy decisions.\nRésumé\nCe cours de microéconomie examine les raisons pour lesquelles les marchés peuvent ne pas atteindre une efficacité économique et le rôle de l'intervention gouvernementale pour remédier à ces défaillances.

This chapter also provides an analysis of the impact of various economic policies and external shocks on the trade balance, capital flows, and exchange rates, offering a broader view of the mechanisms that drive international exchanges.\nThe second chapter centers on the Solow growth model, a foundational tool for understanding the determinants of economic growth. This model allows for an assessment of the effects of various economic shocks on capital accumulation and long-term income levels. In this chapter, we explore how factors such as technological advancements, demographic changes, and the savings rate influence the trajectory of economic growth in both the short and long term.\nRésumé\nCe TD de macroéconomie est structuré en deux grands chapitres.
